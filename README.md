The Crime Record Management System (CRMS) is a project I developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. It's designed to help manage and track crime data efficiently. Users can log in, add or update records, and search for cases using criteria like case ID or criminal name. It also generates insights and reports to improve law enforcement efficiency.
